## Problem Description
Currently, EAFIT students and staff lack a reliable and organized source of information about vendors on campus. This makes it difficult to find shopping options, compare prices, and access specific products. Our application solves this by providing a digital catalog with detailed vendor information, improving the connection between buyers and sellers.
